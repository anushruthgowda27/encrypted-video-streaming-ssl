# Encrypted Real-Time Video Streaming System Using Sockets and SSL

This project implements a secure real-time video streaming system between a client and server using Python, OpenCV, sockets, and SSL. The video data is transmitted over a secure SSL connection to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

## Features

- Real-time video streaming from server to client.
- SSL encryption for secure data transmission.
- Socket-based communication between the client and server.
- Low-latency video transmission using OpenCV for video capture and display.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language used to implement the system.
- **OpenCV**: Used for video capture and display.
- **Sockets**: For network communication between the server and client.
- **SSL**: For securing video transmission over the network.
- **Pickle**: For serializing and deserializing video frames.
- **Struct**: For packing and unpacking message lengths.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- SSL certificates (self-signed or obtained from a certificate authority)
- Install dependencies:


## Usage
- Start the server using the provided server code.
- Run the client code on a different machine or in a separate terminal to view the real-time video stream.
